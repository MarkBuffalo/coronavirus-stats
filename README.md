# ðŸ¦  Coronavirus Discord Bot ðŸ¤–

This is a bot for discord that's designed to help you get updated information on current coronavirus statistics.

This guide assumes you know how to set up and run a discord bot. That is unfortunately beyond the scope of this readme, but I'll give you some TLDR steps:

1. [Create a bot for Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) on their developer page.
2. Get your token and server id
3. Visit the generated URL and allow it access to your discord server.
4. Create an `.env` file in the same folder as `coronavirus-stats-discord-bot.py`
5. Update the `.env` file with your token and server ID.

# Dumb Design Problem

You will occasionally need to type:

```
!update
```

In order to update U.S. states. 

This is mostly due to the way I designed the program. This was created in a hurry (<2 hours), so it's not meant to be production quality. 


# Missing Countries

- `South Korea` exists, but it's  `S. Korea`
