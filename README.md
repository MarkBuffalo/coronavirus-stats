# ðŸ¤– Discord Bot: Coronavirus Stats ðŸ¦  ðŸ“ˆ 

This is a bot for discord that's designed to help you get updated information on current coronavirus statistics. This bot provides information for **countries**, **states** and **the world**. 

Before you scroll down to the instructions, etc., consider reading about what you can do to help slow this pandemic. I've added some common sense here.

# What can I do to help stop this pandemic?

## You can practice Social Distancing 

Please consider Social Distancing. It really works and really helps save lives. Here's why:

Just because you are healthy doesn't mean you can't pass the disease to others and kill them.


## You can remember The FIVE.

1. **HANDS** - Wash them often
2. **ELBOW** - Cough into it
3. **FACE** - Don't touch it
4. **SPACE** - Keep safe distance
5. **HOMES** - Stay if you can

# Why did you make this?

I'm trying to do my part to help stop the spread of misinformation. You can help too!

There's a lot of bad information surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. You've probably heard a million and a half people downplaying the severity for months. This bot attempts to show you basic stats that the average person can understand.

Please get your information from the [Center for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and reputable media outlets such as [CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com). 

A lot of well-meaning individuals are pushing bogus information without realizing it. However, most major media companies, vet their information before airing it, so stick with reputable media outlets.

# Requirements

- pip3
- docker (optional)

# Install

## Part One

### Without Docker

Edit `.env-sample` and rename to `.env`

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 coronavirus-stats-discord-bot.py
```

### With Docker

Edit `.env-sample` and rename to `.env`

```
docker build -t coronavirus-stats .
docker run -ti coronavirus-stats
```

## Part Two 

This guide assumes you know how to set up and run a discord bot. That is unfortunately beyond the scope of this readme, but I'll give you some TLDR steps:

1. [Create a bot for Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) on their developer page.
2. Get your token and server id
3. Visit the generated URL and allow it access to your discord server.
4. Rename `.env-sample` to `.env`
5. Update the `.env` file with your token and server ID.


# Forking

If you want to easily add your own commands, it's now very easy. You can just look at this function:

- `def get_master_command_dict(self):`

Just update the dictionary with a command and a value. 

The key will be the trigger, e.g.: `"!state":`, and the `value` will point to a function that does whatever you want. This is the only thing you need to update.

All of this assumes the `message` parameter will be passed to the function. See `def on_message(self, message)` for how it's parsed using `await value(message)`. 


# Usage

## To run

```$ python3 coronavirus-stats-discord-bot.py```

or if using Docker:
